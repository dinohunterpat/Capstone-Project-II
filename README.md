# Capstone-Project-II

## Problem
Given the increasing number of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases, there has been interest in studying the demographics behind this conditions. Many aspects of ASDâ€™s demographics are not fully understood such as whether certain demographics are more likely to be diagnosed with ASD or show symptoms. As such, understanding the demographic features would be vital to developing further research and treatment options.
 
## Data Source
The dataset was originally posted on Kaggle by the Manukau Institute of Technology from Auckland, New Zealand. The data itself is a questionnaire conducted on over 700 individuals around the world, and it asks for ASD diagnosis status along with separate demographic attributes. For the project, the gender and ethnicity are the demographic features of interest, and diagnosis status and symptom scoring are the metrics of ASD conditions.

## Clients
The main beneficiaries of this research project are social workers and researchers. Identifying demographics with the highest diagnosis rates and symptoms would be guide social workers in directing resources to communities in need. Furthermore, the outcome of this project can guide Autism researchers into identifying demographics of interest for further research.
